After all that hard work in the lab, you finally have your dataâ€¦ but wait a secondâ€¦ ðŸ˜±  
Itâ€™s in the wrong format?! Donâ€™t worry, I got your back!  

Use this Wide-to-Long Converter to get your data R-ready in a snap.  
Just upload your CSV or Excel file, and it will magically transform it into a long format CSV.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "Enter your name:", ""),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste("Hello", input$name, "!")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
