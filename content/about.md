description: Introduction about myself
title: About
---


Hi! Iâ€™m Sydne, a molecular biologist passionate about applying genetic
and computational tools to develop innovative solutions in the
biotechnology industry. I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology
at the National University of Colombia, and later moved to Canada, where
I earned a Masterâ€™s in Chemical Ecology at the University of Alberta and
a PhD in Molecular Biology at the University of British Columbia.

Most of my research has focused on engineering plants to produce
compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical interest. Along the way, Iâ€™ve
worked with techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9, RNAseq, HPLC, and GC-MS. I
love combining hands-on lab work with computational tools to drive
innovation in biotechnology.

On this site, youâ€™ll find an overview of my research, some of the
computational tools Iâ€™ve developed, and a blog where I share interesting
aspects of my work ðŸŒ¿

This space is also my way of giving back: Iâ€™m committed to making my
work accessible to Spanish-speaking communities interested in science
and biotech. The site is fully bilingual, and I hope it helps inspire
more innovation and collaboration in Latin America and beyond.
