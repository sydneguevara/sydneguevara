Hi! I’m Sydne, a molecular biologist passionate about applying genetic
and computational tools to develop innovative solutions in biotechnology. I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology
at the National University of Colombia, and later moved to Canada, where
I earned a Master’s in Chemical Ecology at the University of Alberta and
a PhD in Molecular Biology at the University of British Columbia.

Most of my research has focused on engineering plants to produce
compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical interest. Along the way, I’ve
worked with techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9, RNAseq, HPLC, and GC-MS.

On this site, you’ll find an overview of my research, some of the
computational tools I’ve developed, and a blog where I share interesting
aspects of my work 🌿
