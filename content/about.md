description: Introduction about myself
title: About
---

Hi! Iâ€™m a molecular biologist with a passion for using genetic engineering and computational tools to solve real-world problems. I completed my Masterâ€™s in Chemical Ecology at the University of Alberta and earned my PhD in Tree Molecular Biology at the University of British Columbia.

Most of my research has focused on engineering plants to produce high-value industrial compounds. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked with techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9, RNAseq, HPLC, and GC-MS. I love combining hands-on lab work with computational tools to drive innovation in biotechnology.

On this site, youâ€™ll find an overview of my research, some of the computational tools Iâ€™ve developed, and a blog where I share interesting aspects of my work ðŸŒ¿

This space is also my way of giving back: Iâ€™m committed to making my work accessible to Spanish-speaking communities interested in science and biotech. The site is fully bilingual, and I hope it helps inspire more innovation and collaboration in Latin America and beyond.

What excites me? Bioinformatics, biochemistry, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, statistics, and anything that blends biology with real-world applications.
