title: About
---

I am a molecular biologist specialized in plant genetic engineering from the University of British Columbia. My primary interests include bioinformatics, biochemistry, and statistics. On this site, you will find information about my research and computational tools I have developed. This webpage is also available in Spanish. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of plant biotechnology in Latin American countries by making my scientific work accessible to Spanish-speaking communities.
