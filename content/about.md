description: Introduction about myself
title: About
---


Hi! Iâ€™m a molecular biologist with a big passion for using genetic engineering and computational tools to solve real-world problems. I completed my Masterâ€™s in Chemical Ecology at the University of Alberta and earned my PhD in Tree Molecular Biology at the University of British Columbia.

Most of my research has focused on engineering plants to produce high-value industrial compounds. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked with techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, RNAseq, HPLC, and GC-MS. I love combining hands-on lab work with computational tools to drive innovation in plant biotechnology.

On this site, youâ€™ll find an overview of my research, some of the computational tools Iâ€™ve developed, and a personal blog where I share thoughts about plants, science, and the cool things we can create with them ðŸŒ¿

This space is also my way of giving back: Iâ€™m committed to making my work available to Spanish-speaking communities who are curious about science and biotech. The site is fully bilingual, and I hope it helps inspire more innovation and collaboration in Latin America and beyond.

What gets me excited? Bioinformatics, biochemistry, synthetic biology, plant genetic engineering, stats, and anything that blends biology with real-world applications.
